/*******************************
 * Implement the Following
 *******************************/

/* First pass of the assembler. You should implement pass_two() first.

   This function should read each line, strip all comments, scan for labels,
   and pass instructions to write_original_code(), pass data to write_static_data(). 
   The symbol table and data segment should also been built and written to 
   specified file. The input file may or may not be valid. Here are some guidelines:

   1. Only one of ".data" or ".text" may be present per line. It must be the 
      first token present. Once you see a ".data" or ".text", the rest part
      will be treat as data or text segment until the next ".data" or ".text"
      Appears. Ignore the rest token of this line. Default to text segment 
      if not indicated.
    
   2. For data segment, we only considering ".word", ".half", ".Byte" types.
      These types must be the first token of a line. The rest of the tokens 
      in this line will be stored as variables of that type in the data segment.
      You can assume that these numbers are legal with their types.

   3. Only one label may be present per line. It must be the first token
      present. Once you see a label, regardless of whether it is a valid label
      or invalid label, You can treat the NEXT token in this line as the 
      beginning of an instruction or a static data.

   4. If the first token is not a label, treat it as the name of an
      instruction. DO NOT try to check it is a valid instruction in this pass.
   
   5. Everything after the instruction name in the same line should be treated 
      as arguments to that instruction. If there are more than MAX_ARGS 
      arguments, call raise_extra_argument_error() and pass in the first extra 
      argument. Do not write that instruction to the original file (eg. don't call
      write_original_code())
   
   6. Only one instruction should be present per line. You do not need to do
       anything extra to detect this - it should be handled by guideline 5.
   
   8. A line containing only a label is valid. The address of the label should
      be the address of the next instruction or static data regardless of 
      whether there is a next instruction or static data or not.
   
   9. If an instruction contains an immediate, you should output it AS IS.
   
   10. Comments should always be skipped before any further process.

   11. Note that the starting address of the text segment is defined as TEXT_BASE
   in "../types.", and the starting address of the data segment is defined as 
   DATA_BASE in "../types.".

   12. Think about how you should use write_original_code() and write_static_data().
   
   Just like in pass_two(), if the function encounters an error it should NOT
   exit, but process the entire file and return -1. If no errors were
   encountered, it should return 0.

/* Second pass of the assembler.

   This function should read an original file and the corresponding symbol table
   file, translates it into basic code and machine code. You may assume:
    1. The input file contains no comments
    2. The input file contains no labels
    3. The input file contains at maximum one instruction per line
    4. All instructions have at maximum MAX_ARGS arguments
    5. The symbol table file is well formatted
    6. The symbol table file contains all the symbol required for translation
    7. The line may contain only one "-" which is placeholder you can ignore.
   If an error is reached, DO NOT EXIT the function. Keep translating the rest of
   the document, and at the end, return -1. Return 0 if no errors were encountered. */
